CachyOS runner host dependencies are ready.

Dayloop CI provisions its own JDK 17, Android SDK 35, Build Tools 35.0.0,
and Gradle dependencies. Dayloop's main CI is cross-platform and may run on
any x64 self-hosted runner.

ShadowGarden verify is also cross-platform. Its Playwright E2E and release
jobs require a Linux x64 self-hosted runner; this host satisfies that pool.

Required built-in labels for this host:
  self-hosted, Linux, X64

Custom labels such as steamdeck/cachyos are fine, but the repos no longer
require them for dispatch.
