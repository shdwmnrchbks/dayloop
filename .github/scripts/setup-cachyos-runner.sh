CachyOS runner host dependencies are ready.

Dayloop CI will provision:
  - JDK 17
  - Android SDK platform 35
  - Android Build Tools 35.0.0
  - Gradle dependencies/caches

ShadowGarden CI will provision:
  - Node.js 22
  - npm dependencies
  - Playwright 1.62.1 browsers and Linux libraries through its pinned container

The GitHub runner itself must have these labels:
  self-hosted, Linux, X64, steamdeck
