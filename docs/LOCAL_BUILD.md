# Local build setup (Windows)

How this machine is configured to build dayloop without Android Studio.

## Toolchain locations

| Tool | Location | Version |
|---|---|---|
| JDK (Temurin 17) | `C:\Users\airenz1202\.dsh-tools\jdk-17` | 17.0.20.1 |
| Gradle (bootstrap only) | `C:\Users\airenz1202\.dsh-tools\gradle-8.10.2` | 8.10.2 |
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\airenz1202\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` | — |
| Git (MinGit) | `C:\Users\airenz1202\.dsh-tools\mingit` | 2.55.0 |

The Gradle wrapper (`gradlew.bat`) is the canonical way to build; the full
Gradle distribution above was only used to generate the wrapper.

## Environment variables

Set at **user level** (effective in newly opened terminals):

- `JAVA_HOME = C:\Users\airenz1202\.dsh-tools\jdk-17`
- `ANDROID_HOME = C:\Users\airenz1202\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`
- `PATH` += `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh-tools\mingit\cmd` (for `git`)
- `PATH` += `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools` (for `adb`)

`local.properties` in the repo root pins `sdk.dir` for Gradle (gitignored).

## Installed SDK packages

- `platforms;android-35` (compile/target SDK)
- `build-tools;35.0.0`
- `platform-tools` (adb, fastboot)

Licenses were pre-accepted via the standard license-hash files in
`<sdk>\licenses\` (same mechanism CI images use).

## Building

```powershell
cd C:\Users\airenz1202\Desktop\dayloop
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug       # debug APK -> app\build\outputs\apk\debug\
.\gradlew.bat assembleCandidate   # prerelease test APK -> app\build\outputs\apk\candidate\
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease     # stable APK -> app\build\outputs\apk\release\
.\gradlew.bat test                # unit tests
.\gradlew.bat lint                # Android lint
```

The `candidate` build type is for hands-on prerelease testing. It uses the
standard Android debug signing key and application-id suffix `.candidate`, so
it can coexist with a production-signed Dayloop install. Candidate profiles,
progress, widgets and settings are therefore isolated from the stable app.
Production `release` signing uses the gitignored `keystore.properties` setup
when those credentials are present. For private CI and local verification where
that file is absent, it falls back to Android's debug key so the stable APK is
installable; public distribution must use the persistent production key.

First build downloads all dependencies (several hundred MB) and takes a
while; later builds are incremental and much faster.

## Notes

- The toolchain lives outside the repo; nothing here except `local.properties`
  (gitignored) is machine-specific.
- If Android Studio is installed later, point it at the SDK path above and it
  will reuse everything.
- An emulator/AVD is **not** installed yet — `adb install` the candidate/debug
  APK to a physical device with USB debugging enabled, or ask for an AVD setup.
